# Changelog

## 1.1.0 - 2019-03
### New for users
- Hook scripts
    {{config_path}}/autosr/hooks
    Each event directory under hooks contains executables that will run when that event occurs.
    For example, having an executable "notify.py" in the "end-save" directory will run notify.py every time autosr completes a save.
